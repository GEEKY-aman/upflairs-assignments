    <h1>My Favorite Hobby: Painting</h1>
    
    <h2>Why I Love Painting</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Painting</b> has been my favorite hobby since childhood. It allows me to express my emotions and imagination on canvas. 
      I often find myself lost in the <i>colors, strokes, and shapes</i> that come together to create something meaningful. <br /><br />
      Every time I pick up a brush, I feel <u>relaxed and focused</u>. It’s a perfect escape from the digital noise of daily life.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Paint</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy creating both <b>abstract</b> and <i>realistic</i> paintings. Sometimes, I paint natural landscapes, while other times 
      I experiment with bold colors and patterns. <u>Watercolors</u> are my favorite medium, though I occasionally use acrylics for more vibrant tones. <br /><br />
      Through painting, I not only develop patience and creativity but also get a deep sense of satisfaction and achievement.
